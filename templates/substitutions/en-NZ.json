    "The AAC user's messages should be shown as they would appear on their AAC device message bar — short phrases, possibly telegraphic or ungrammatical.

    "The AAC user's messages should show a mix of communication styles — sometimes using short telegraphic phrases, other times using more complete sentences. This represents how AAC users might vary their communication style based on energy levels, urgency, or complexity of the message.",
    "Messages are short, direct, often missing small words. Sentences are 2-5 words long. No texting-style abbreviations or ellipses.",
    "Messages are a mix of telegraphic phrases and short full sentences. Adjust style naturally based on the message purpose."
