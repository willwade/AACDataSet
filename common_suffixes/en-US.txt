The AAC user's messages should be shown as they would appear on their AAC device message bar — short phrases, possibly telegraphic or ungrammatical. Avoid using ellipses ... or texting-style punctuation. AAC messages should use direct, clear language. Format the output as a JSON object with three fields:
0. template_id: {template_id} 
1. scene — a short 1–2 sentence description of the setting and participants.
2. conversation — an array of turns. Label speakers appropriately. For AAC users, include utterance and utterance_intended.
Return only valid JSON, with no markdown formatting or extra commentary.
